# Automatic-Image-Colorization
In this project, we address the problem of adding colors to gray-scle images across a wide range of classes - both containing simple scene-level background classes (like sky, mountains etc.), and complex scenes with multiple foreground objects (like people and animals). We propose a convolutional-neural-network-based system that colorizes black and white photographic images without human assistance. Two pre-trained neural nets, VGG16 and ResNet50, are used as feature extractors. We then developed a residual-style encoder that output 2 color chaneels for the input image. Moreover, we experiment on adding semantic feature learning from a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) for successfully do colorization in complex images with foreground objects.
